# Complex Engineering Problem Activity (CEPA)
In  this  Complex  Engineering  Problem  Activity  (CEPA)  you  will  implement  the frequency control as well as voltage control on generation side with its protection and also  shunt  compensation  on  the  load  side  with  OC  protection  under  varying  load conditions to reduce the unnecessary burden on the transmission line. 
#### Task: 
1. Identify and connect the required equipment for the said activity.
2. Ensure the safety precautions during the wiring. 
3. Initialize the system on the No-load. 
4. Analyze the operation of Synchronous Generator at no load and Full load characteristics  
5. Analyze the effect of voltage and frequency control in power system
6. Protection of Generator with OV/UV and OF/UF values 
7. Analyze the effect of voltage regulation on load side by using SCADA 
8. OC protection on load side 
####  Important Instruction to perform this task:  
1. Use MSCom Software for the data acquisition.
2. First energize the field winding then the armature winding in separately excited DC
